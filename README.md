# CyanBat
CyanBat is a side-scrolling 2d video game for android. It's inspired by 2D retro classics like Gradius and more modern takes on the genre like FlappyBird.

## Current State
The project has been updated to support the latest android releases, including API Level 28/Android 9 Pie. It's also updated to make use of AndroidX and its Support Libraries.

## Background
This is an old school project of mine from 2012. It's written using as many native android features as possible. The game engine is based on the book Beginning Android Games by Mario Zechner and Robert Green. The initial implementation/template of the game framework has been supplied by a former professor of mine, DI Robert Gr√ºneis in 2012.
